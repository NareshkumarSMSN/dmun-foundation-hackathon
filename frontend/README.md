# DMUN Foundation Website

## What We're Building

This is the frontend for the DMUN Foundation website. We're working on building out functional, responsive components that will make up the final site.

## What We've Done So Far

We've completed a few key pieces:

**Executive Login System** - We built out a basic login system that handles authentication and includes proper validation. It's functional and ready to be expanded with more features down the line.

**Footer Design** - We created a responsive footer component that includes contact information, quick links to important pages, and social media links. It adapts well to different screen sizes.

**Case Study** - We took some time to review the existing DNUM website to identify areas where we could make improvements and learn from what's already there.

## Current Status

Right now, we've focused on getting the footer and login system working. There's still a lot more to build, but we wanted to make sure these core pieces were solid before moving forward. The rest of the pages and features are planned for upcoming milestones.

## What's Next

Looking ahead, we're planning to:
- Finish building out the Executive Leadership page
- Add some polish to the footer with icons and maybe some subtle animations
- Expand the login system to include user dashboards and support for different user roles

We're making steady progress and excited to keep building!
