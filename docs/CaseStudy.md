Milestone 1 - Website Case Study

I spent some time exploring the DMUN Foundation website, and I can see they're doing good work around youth empowerment. The mission comes through clearly, and that's going to resonate with students who are looking to get involved in Model UN.

The Reflections section has real content that feels authentic, and the Publications area shows they're actually producing resources. The About page does a solid job establishing credibility.

But here's the thing - when I tried to actually navigate the site as a potential delegate, it wasn't super clear what I should do next. The CTAs blend into the background, and there's no real distinction between paths for individual delegates versus schools trying to register groups. The site could also use more visual interest - it's pretty text-heavy right now.

I looked at a few other MUN organization sites for comparison, and most of them have stronger visual elements, clearer role-based navigation, and better search functionality. Some even have delegate toolkits that make it easier for new participants to get started.

For this hackathon, I'm thinking we should tackle a few key areas:
- Clean up the navigation and footer - make it easier to find things
- Build role-based authentication so execs, co-leads, and delegates each get a tailored experience
- Create a document assistant that helps delegates prepare for conferences
- Add semantic search so people can actually find relevant programs and publications

These feel like the most impactful changes we can make given the time constraints, and they directly address the pain points I noticed.
