# Milestone 2 - Footer Enhancement

I've added a footer component to the DNUM website as part of Milestone 2. The footer was built using React with CSS modules for styling, which helps keep the styles scoped and maintainable.

The footer includes several key sections:
- Contact information so visitors can reach out
- Quick links to important pages
- Social media links for connecting on various platforms

I made sure the footer is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout adapts nicely to different screen sizes.

Since we're working within a tight timeline, I kept this initial version straightforward and functional. There's definitely room for improvement down the line—we could add icons, refine the styling, and enhance the overall visual design. But for now, it serves its purpose and provides users with the essential information they need.
